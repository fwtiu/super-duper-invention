# super-duper-invention

This repository will host a simple React TODO application.
The goal is to demonstrate Codex's ability to collaborate on building a React
project from scratch. We will incrementally add features such as creating,
listing and deleting TODO items while keeping the codebase minimal.

Stay tuned for further instructions on setting up and running the app.
