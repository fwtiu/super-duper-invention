# super-duper-invention

This repository hosts a simple React TODO application scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
The project will be extended incrementally to add TODO management features such as creating,
listing and deleting items while keeping the codebase minimal.

## Getting started

1. Navigate into the `my-app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Vite will start a local dev server and print a URL that you can open in your browser.
